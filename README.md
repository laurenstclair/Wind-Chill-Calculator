# Wind Chill Calculator :wind_face:

## About  :cloud:
A small web application to calculate the wind chill factor using the actual temperature and wind speed in either Metric or Imperial measurements. It is often misunderstood how wind chill is calculated, yet wind chill plays a significant role in weather perception. Wind chill is calculated using the wind speed and actual temperature to find the perceieved temperature. The wind chill can be calculated through the input of the actual temperature (Air Temp.) and wind speed (Wind Speed). The calculation can be performed in Metric or Imperial as controlled by the slider. 

The following application is based on [florinpop17's Windchill-App](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Windchill-App.md) a part of their app-ideas repository. The calculation of wind chill factor in Metric and Imperial used references the equations from the [following article](https://sciencing.com/calculate-wind-chill-factor-5981683.html).
